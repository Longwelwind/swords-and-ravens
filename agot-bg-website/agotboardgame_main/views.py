            <p>Lords and ladies,</p>

            <p>Sorry for the radio silence since Longwelwind stepped back from development. I just couldn't find the muse to write until now.</p>

            <p>I've got some exciting updates to share. I've been busy behind the scenes, and I&apos;m thrilled to announce that all three&nbsp;official&nbsp;expansions&nbsp;â€”&nbsp;<b>
            Dance with Dragons</b>, <b>Feast for Crows</b> and <b>Mother of Dragons</b>&nbsp;â€”&nbsp;are now fully integrated into the platform!&nbsp;ðŸŽ‰ But that's not all;
            I&apos;ve also added a bunch of custom variants to keep your games fresh and exciting.</p>

            <p>One of the coolest new features is the <b>Dragon War</b> mode, where each house starts with their very own dragon.
            This is sure to add a fiery twist to your strategies.</p>

            <p>In addition to these expansions, we&apos;ve rolled out several fundamental features to enhance your gaming experience:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Modular Integration of MoD Elements:</b> You can now enjoy elements from Mother of Dragons like the Iron Bank in any scenario, even
                without the Essos side board.</li>
                <li><b>Draft House Cards:</b> A fan-favorite that lets you draft house cards and influence positions before the game begins, adding
                a strategic layer from the start.</li>
                <li><b>Live Game Clock:</b> Keep the game moving with timed turns, just like in chess.</li>
                <li><b>Ingame Replacement by Vote:</b> Seamlessly replace players during ongoing games.</li>
                <li><b>Vassal System as a Player Elimination Mechanic:</b> Available in every game, this is the official solution for handling players
                who leave or can be considered eliminated in live games.</li>
                <li><b>Animations, Sound, and Ingame Music:</b> Special thanks to <b><a href="https://liliannecoeverden.com/" target="_blank" style="color: white">Lilianne Coeverden</a></b> for contributing the sounds for the 8 houses.</li>
                <li><b>Many More Fun Variants:</b> Explore exciting options like House Card Evolution, Blind Draft, and more.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Thanks for your patience and continued support. Enjoy crossing swords and mastering ravens!</p>

            <p>Happy gaming,<br>

            <p>
                These past few months have seen the introduction of 2 major features to <b>Swords
                and Ravens</b>: the Dance of Dragons expansion (courtesy of mmasztalerczuk and Gereon), and
                the Vassal feature from Mother of Dragons (courtesy of Gereon). You can now
                create a game and toggle these features to test them out! Remember though that they are still
                in Beta, and that bugs might still happen.
            </p>
            <p>
                This month also marks the 1-year anniversary of S&R! More than 1400 games have been played up until now,
                and the platform draws around active 300 players every day. ðŸŽ‰<br/>
            </p>
            <p>
                If you've monitored the activity of the GitHub repository, you might have noticed that
                I, Longwelwind, have not actively contributed to the project for a few months now. Indeed, while I greatly
                enjoyed coding S&R at first, my time and my motivation for the project diminished over time, and I'm
                now at a point where I'd like to move on to other projects. I've handed the keys to the kingdoms
                (i.e. admin rights to the production server) to Gereon, who has been
                contributing to the project since its beginning and to whom we can thank for
                all the recent additions to the platform.
            </p>
            <p>
                As for me, I'm not done with online board games! I've learned a lot while developping S&R,
                and I'm currently experimenting on <b>Ravens</b>, a library that would allow
                anyone with coding skills to develop their own online-multiplayer board game. While it's still
                in the prototype phase at the moment, I hope I'll have a working beta for those who are interested.

            </p>

            <p>
                The game also evolved a lot since launch: variants for games with less than 6 players have
                appeared, a forum has been added to discuss everything about the game, a lot of UI improvements
                were made and a ton of bugs have been squashed. Around 800 commits were made on the codebase,
                available on <a href="https://github.com/Longwelwind/swords-and-ravens" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, some of
                them done by <a href="https://github.com/Longwelwind/swords-and-ravens/graphs/contributors" target="_blank">external

                The <a href="https://community.swordsandravens.net" target="_blank">forum</a> has been launched, to discuss
                everything related to the game and the development of Swords and Ravens, don't hesitate to check
                it out!
            </p>

            <p>
                It's not over, obviously. The Vassals mechanic, which appeared in the MoD extension, is
                progressing and will be playable in the coming months. Multiple other meta-game features such
                as abuse reports, player statistics and localization are also planned, and should be available
                once I find the time to work on them. ðŸ˜›
            </p>

            <p>
                Thanks to all the players who made this possible, and I hope S&R will allow many more games to
                be played!
